# Arduino-transciever
This is my ongoing project of making a multiband arduino transciever,the range is MF,HF,VHF  and mabye UHF
Also this might not work,i'm putting it here son if something desn't you gys can help me
I'm going to implement a 4x4 membrane keyboard for the frquency input later on,for now you are gonna have to change the frequency manually from the script
little disclamer:trasmitting on radio frequencie under 45 GHz is illegal,so make sure to have your radio ham license before doing anything strange!
Anyway,feel free to tell me what i should add or remove!
